Being on my second project with Flatiron school has made me realize that I've learned a lot, but I still know so little. In the end though, the feeling of finishing was definetly satisfying, even if imposter syndrome and I have a long lasting battle. With that being said, allow me to explain my insparation behind this project.

In my regular day life, I engage in social media just as most people. This project was inspired by one of those occasions, where my significant other introduced me to a Facebook group where people took pictures of terrible parked cars in public places (covering the plates of course). That's when I decided, there should be a site for that. Just comments and pictures of people who never learned to park. There are suprisingly a lot of them. Of course this would mean that I would have to find a way to add images to Sinatra, and save them to active record. Thankfully, I was up for the challenge.

With the help of carrierwave gem and a lot of googling, I figured out a way to achieve my goal. My project is able to sign up and sign in a user, and create, read, edit, and delete an image with a description, alongside being able to see images from others, to keep things interesting. As stated before, imposter syndrome was right there with me, but I am proud to say that I didn't cave and give up, even if I considered it a lot. With uncertainties, I look forward to my next project, hoping that one day I'll look back at all of this and laugh, as most do when they succeed. To be continued.
