Hello to whomever may decide to read this. Thank you for coming onto my blog, even if it is temporarily.

Let's start with something interesting. I'm a 99s baby, and I have an identical twin sister. I am also an essential worker during COVID19 (at least for now), so it will be interesting to see how I manage school/work/personal life.

My name is **Christerle Nounoute(Chris-tell Nuu-nuut)**. I am a healthcare professional hoping to break into tech to help improve healthcare. I've always been interested in the coding aspects of technology, and thankfully I now have the opportunity to explore and learn about what it is and how to use it. 

I graduated school at 15. Not because I'm a genius; I'm a goody two shoes that went homeschooling so I wouldn't be a difficult teenager in my parents' eyes. Because of this, I went to college young. I had no idea what I wanted to do, and listened to my mother's advice to study something in the healthcare field, and it had to be in a college campus near home. That's why I became an Occupational Therapy Assistant, obtaining my associate degree in science. It got me a decent job with steady income, although I had to move across the country to do so. But now, I'm 21, and I want to do more. That's why I decided to become a software engineer. I've always loved the idea of working with and understanding how computers work, and it definetly wouldn't be the worst thing in the world to create my own application one day.

That's where Career Karma comes in. Here I am innocently looking through the app store for apps to help me start learning to code, when I found CK. They helped get my foot in the door. I completed the #21dayCKchallenge on twitter, I interviewed with various bootcamps (and eventually got accepted to Flatiron), and I'm working on creating a squad to go through this learning process together. And now, I'm working on my blog on learn.co. I'm hoping to document my improvement during this bootcamp, which I plan on completing in one year at the most. With these small improvements that I've already demonstated, I couldn't be more hopeful or motivated than if I were offered a job right now, as a student in software engineering.

Anyways, this is the first of many posts. I can't wait to write about the ups and downs I expeirence through technology. See you soon.
