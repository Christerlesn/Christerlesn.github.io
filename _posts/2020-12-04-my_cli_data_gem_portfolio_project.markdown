I've just completed my first portfolio project with Flatiron School, and I must say, it was quite an experience. As a self paced student, I was afraid that I wasn't learning enough, and even considered switching to part time or full time to fully benefit from this school. This project helped reassure that I am actually doing quite okay. The creaters of Learn.co definitely tried their best to provide everything that a student would need, and they succeded.

I'm not saying that this project was easy, because it was possibly the exact opposite. But after compelting it, I got a feeling of accomplishment, and pride. It's a simple project that scrappes from the merced county events page, but I'm quite proud of it. The resources provided helped a lot, and I've gotten much better at googling for answers to fix problems that I create, then resolve. Once I got around to the video, I had a huge sigh of relief, and I am actually starting to believe that I just might make it through this program. Dare I say, I kind of look forwards to the next project to see how much more I've learned. So I just want to say thank you Flatiron staff, I've got my confidence back (for now, lol).
