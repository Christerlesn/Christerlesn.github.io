Have you ever felt thrilled and terrified at the same time, and just decided that they are one and the same? That's how I felt completing the Rails project. I cannot believe I have gotten so far, but I am also worried that I am falling behind because I'm not on the scheduled path that I want to be. Not that I am too far behind, I just have way to high expectations for myself. 

I actually enjoyed the Rails project quite a bit. I used quite a bit of Flatiron's Learn Instruct Beta website, which for those of you who don't know, is a website full of videos of instructors completing projects, I'm assuming covering all of the curriculum. I have never been more thankful for an online school than I have for that website, so shoutout to Flatiron for thinking of the students. Anyways...

My project is called the 'Huge House'. To simply put it, it's supposed to be a website for an event center where a client can make a reservation in the huge house, which is a huge building that has the vibe of a house to throw events in. The project hits all the requirements (at least I hope so, won't know until after the mock interview). The client can sign up, log in through the regular log in, or connect through a social media platform provided. Then they can see all the reservations, make a reservation and and vendors to their events, made through the reservations. I eventually plan on adding a calendar, and adding rooms to the house and so much more, but for now, I met the requirements and I'm just studying intensly to do some on the spot coding when the time comes (*wish me luck!*). I know the project has a lot more to go, and I plan on doing so much more with it, but for now, I am just so proud that I was able, *AM* able to, actually complete an almost completely functioning website. I still dream of working as a software engineer one day, and everyday that I work on Flatiron, I feel I am getting closer to my dream.

I actually kind of look forward to Java Script, and I may regret saying this, but I hope I continue have to complete more challenging tasks, as I improve myself and become more and more of an expert at googling. As I'd like to assume we all, if not most of us, are becoming. To the past self, who doubted I'd get this far, to my future self, who is probably hoping I succeed, I will chat with my dear readers again sometime soon, with my next amazing project.
